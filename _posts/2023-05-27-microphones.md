### What is a Microphone? {#what}

The invention of the microphone opened up the world to mass media. Without the ability to transform acoustic energy into electrical energy, there would be no radio broadcasts or loud rock concerts. This electroacoustic development was no easy feat, but through the brains of many fine physicists, the microphone became a reality. Since its inception, the microphone has taken on many forms – each with its own defining characteristics. From ribbons to condensers, the world of microphone electronics is a complex science of electronics and acoustics.

To understand the microphone, we must first understand the concept of a transducer. A transducer is an object that takes one form of energy and converts it into another. A simple example of a transducer is that of two tin cans on a string. The cans turn the acoustic energy of a spoken word into mechanical energy as it vibrates through the string and then process is reversed by the opposite can. In the case of a microphone, we are converting acoustic energy into electric energy by a slightly more complicated process. Imagine a circuit consisting of a DC power source and two resistors in series. The first resistor is variable while the second is fixed. As the value of the first resistor is varied, the voltage over the second resistor also fluctuates. If the first resistor varies in time with an acoustic input and we take the voltage output over the second resistor, the electrical output is a representation of the acoustic energy inputted. At this point, we just need to replace the first resistor with an acoustic device that can vary the resistance and we have a functional microphone.

The carbon microphone was the first working design of an electroacoustic transducer. This format of microphone was used in the first radio broadcast and is still found in some phone receivers. Essentially, this design replaces the first resistor of the previously talked about circuit with a pocket of carbon particles attached to a diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates with incoming acoustic waves and causes the carbon particles to expand and contract with the incoming air propagations. The compression and expansion of the charged carbon particles creates a varying resistance that creates a voltage over the secondary resistor.

As we know, maximum power transfer occurs when the impedance of the load is equal to source impedance. The same holds true in microphone design. Usually the capsules have a differing output than the preamp they feed into. On account of this fact, most microphones have on board transformers to help better transfer the signal. Not only do these transformers help match impedances, but they usually provide an increase in the output of the microphone as they step up the voltage of the microphone signal.

### Ribbon Microphones {#ribbon}

Since the invention of the carbon microphone, many have expanded on its basic design. The most common type of microphones these days are called dynamic microphones. These microphones are designated into two subcategories: ribbon and moving coil. They both work on a principle of electromagnetism, which states that a moving conductor in an electromagnetic field will have a voltage produced across it. With ribbon microphones, there is a thin aluminum strip or “ribbon” suspended between opposing poles of a strong magnet. Either end of the ribbon is pinned down, but free to move about in the middle. As acoustic waves hit the ribbon it moves about in the electromagnetic field inducing a voltage which is telegraphed through the microphone as an electrical representation of the acoustic signal. Ribbon mics have a very low output due to the general small size of the metal strip and as such they usually have step up transformers which increase the output and better match impedances with a preamp. If we increase the physical size of the ribbon and/or the strength of the magnet, there is an increase of output at the expense of frequency response and overall usability due to size. Usually however ribbon microphones have a very smooth frequency response and excellent portrayal of transients.

### Dynamic Microphones {#dynamic}

Moving coil microphones are also considered dynamic microphones. They work on the same principle of electromagnetism as ribbon mics using a slightly different construction. With moving coil design, a coil of wire is attached to a plastic diaphragm that is free to move back and forth. The coil slides along a magnet as the diaphragm moves with acoustical energy a voltage is produced across the wire. As the coil has more mass than that of a ribbon, the transient response is slower considering the attack must be much more powerful to move the coil as much. However, due to the winding of the coil, the output produced from the coil is much higher. Moving coil microphones are also much more rugged than their frail ribbon mic counterparts. The ribbon is prone to being knocked out of its magnetic field or otherwise damaged from simply too much air passing it, while the wound coil is much more durable. There are even youtube videos where people run them over with trucks or use them as hammers and they still work!

### Condenser Microphones {#condenser}

Another genre of microphone is the condenser microphone. These microphones use capacitance to incite an output voltage. Essentially, the capsule is created using two charged plates with dielectric material between them. One of these plates is fixed while the other is movable. The movable plate in this instance is in fact a plastic diaphragm coated in a thin layer of gold to make it conductive. If we consider the formula: C = (eKA)/d, where e is the charge of an electron, K is the dielectric constant, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between the plates, one can see that changing the distance between the plates will directly affect the capacitance produced. As the plates are pushed closer together, the voltage increases. Condensers have a very high impedance at the capsule. They use a step down transformer to work more efficiently with their build in preamplifiers. Condensers require an external power source to run properly. This power source is referred to as phantom power. “Phantom” because it is a DC input of 48 volts that runs along the AC output coming through a specific pin on the microphone connection. This voltage powers the on board preamp, as well as providing a charge for the plates of the capsule. Condenser microphones are known for having a very smooth, bright frequency response with a high output and quick transient response. While every mic has its strong suits these are most often used in recording studios.

### Conclusion {#conclusion}
                
Media has never been the same since the invention of the microphone. With the ability to transmit sound waves by radio waves or even just to amplify an orator’s voice in a hall, we have gained so much from this incredible tool. From the age old tin can on a string to the microphones used in professional recording studios, the science of microphone electronics has jumped leaps and bounds. While they come in all shapes, sizes, styles, and designs; microphones have created a world of music and media that never could have been conceived of in the past.
